 * Introduction: 
 * The convex hull of a set of N points is 
 * the smallest perimeter fence enclosing the points.
 * 
 * Output: 
 * Sequence of vertices in counterclockwise order.
 * 
 * Implement Application:
 * a) Mechanical algorithm:
 * Hammer nails perpendicular to plane; stretch elastic rubber band around points.
 * 
 * b) Robot motion planning:
 * Find shortest path in the plane from s to t that avoids a polygonal obstacle
 * 
 * c) Farthest pair problem:
 * Given N points in the plane, find a pair of points 
 * with the largest Euclidean distance between them.
 * 
 * More information:
 * CCW: Given three points a, b, and c, is a → b → c a counterclockwise turn?
