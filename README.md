## Chapter 1

### 1.4 Analysis of Algorithms
#### Running time

Scientific method:

* Observe some feature of the natural world.
* Hypothesize a model that is consistent with the observations.
* Predict events using the hypothesis.
* Verify the predictions by making further observations.
* Validate by repeating until the hypothesis and observations agree.

Principles:

* Experiments must be reproducible.
* Hypotheses must be falsifiable.

#### Running memory
...

#### Common order-of-growth classifications
1, logN, N, N*log N, N^2, N^3, and 2^N

#### Types of analyses
* Best case. Lower bound on cost.
* Worst case. Upper bound on cost.
* Average case. “Expected” cost.

#### Theory of algorithms
Goals.
* Establish “difficulty” of a problem.
* Develop “optimal” algorithms.

Approach.
* Suppress details in analysis: analyze “to within a constant factor”.
* Eliminate variability in input model by focusing on the worst case.

Optimal algorithm.
* Performance guarantee (to within a constant factor) for any input.
* No algorithm can provide a better performance guarantee.
